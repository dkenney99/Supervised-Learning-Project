The goal of my project is to build a predictive model that can estimate housing sale prices in Ames, Iowa. This is a classic supervised regression problem with a mix of numeric and categorical features. I chose this dataset because it’s rich enough for meaningful exploration, but still manageable for a course project. It also contains real-world issues like missing values, skewed distributions, and correlated predictors, which makes it perfect for demonstrating end-to-end data cleaning, EDA, and modeling.
